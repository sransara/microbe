# Microbe
**A Micro lang compiler**

The one and only Micro lang compiler that you will need for compiling your precious Micro code in to almighty tiny assembly

Microbe can

- Handle complex expressions
- Build IR
- Do liveness analysis
- Do register allocation
- Produce assembly (tiny)

And also Microbe

- can be easily extended to produce other assembly with (2 or 3 operands)
- IR generation and Tiny Code generation across functions can possibly be parallelized to increase code generation speed

And did you know that microbe can [eat electricity](http://www.iflscience.com/chemistry/scientists-reveal-how-microbe-eats-electricity)?

Follows the specification provided at https://engineering.purdue.edu/~milind/ece573/2014fall/project/

Check under test folder for sample Micro code or how to test Micro
```
#!bash
make
make test
```

Side notes (things to read before being alarmed)

- In spite of common standard to use ArrayList you will observe frequent use of LinkedList in IR Generation because of the frequent *adding* to lists instead of *iterating* through the list
- This program is neither a virus nor a bacterium
